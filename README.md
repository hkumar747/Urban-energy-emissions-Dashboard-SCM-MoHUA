# ISCF Project
## MVP
- Website
- Time viz of energy usage
    - x axis is time
    - y axis is energy usage
    - can switch between:
        - category (type of consumer)
        - transformer (specific consumer transformer)
        - each of these is a line on the graph
- Geographical viz of energy usage
    - Background is location
    - point is transformer
    - a bit of cloud around it
    - color of cloud is how much energy they used

- date
- MTR_NUMBER
    - meter number of a specific consumer
- conload
- imp
    - same as above
### geo_dtr_1day_cons.csv
